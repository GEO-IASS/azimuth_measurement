QGIS Azimuth Measurement documentation
======================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Purpose
-------

This plugin was created to mimic the behaviour from :boltitalic:`Google EarthÂ©` as illustrated below.
We only choose to display information in a widget instead of a dialog.

    :align: center
    :alt: Azimuth in Google Earth

We just want to draw a temporary start point, draw a end point and then display the resulting distance and azimuth.
At the moment, we don't give the option to save the line drawing.

Installation
------------

You just need to install it through the menu `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins...` and choose `Azimuth Measurement`.

.. warning:: You need to tick `Show also Experimental plugins` in `Settings` lateral tab or you will not see the plugin.

Usage
-----

You just have to follow below demonstration to understand how to use the plugin.

For the azimuth calculation, we choose to reuse `pygc <https://github.com/axiom-data-science/pygc>`_, a MIT licensed Python azimuth calculation library (so we can sublicence it in the GPL plugin code). We removed the dependency to `Numpy` Python package from it.


Alternatives
------------

Depending of your requirements, you may prefer using other plugins, more complex and for other use cases:

- `Azimuth and Distance Plugin <http://planet.qgis.org/plugins/qgsAzimuth/>`_
- `Azimuth and Distance Calculator <http://planet.qgis.org/plugins/AzimuthDistanceCalculator/>`_
